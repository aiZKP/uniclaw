"""Public types for ``uniclaw_client``.

Python port of ``packages/client-ts/src/types.ts``. The discriminated
union uses a string ``kind`` field so callers can ``match`` on it
(Python 3.10+ structural pattern matching).

Pending decisions do NOT carry inline ``.approve()`` / ``.deny()``
callbacks (that was idiomatic in TS but awkward in Python's frozen
dataclasses). Resolve a pending receipt explicitly:

    pending = client.evaluate(action)
    if pending.kind == "pending":
        final = client.resolve_approval(
            pending.content_id,
            principal="operator@example.com",
            outcome="approved",
        )
