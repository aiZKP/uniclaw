# Uniclaw

> The model proposes. The kernel decides. The tools execute inside a cage. **And the kernel proves it.**

Uniclaw is a verifiable universal agent runtime built in Rust. It produces signed, third-party-verifiable **receipts** for every consequential agent action — so you can hand a regulator, an auditor, a customer, or a judge a URL that proves what your agent did, without trusting the runtime that produced it.

🦀🦞 Successor to `openclaw | zeroclaw | nanoclaw | openfang | nemoclaw | picoclaw | nullclaw | ironclaw | localclaw`. Adopts designs; never copies code.

## Status

**Pre-alpha.** Phase 0 (Receipt-First Foundation) is in progress.

## Why Uniclaw

Every other agent runtime gives you logs. Uniclaw gives you **receipts** — signed, content-addressed, and verifiable by anyone with a 200-LOC binary that can be installed without installing Uniclaw itself.

Unique to Uniclaw:

- **Public-URL receipts.** Every high-risk action mints a receipt at `uniclaw://receipt/<hash>`. Verifiable cold by any auditor.
- **Constitution engine.** Human-readable rules separate from the model, judging proposals before the policy gate.
- **Capability budget algebra.** Leases carry numeric budgets that compose on delegation and shrink with use.
- **Provenance graph.** Typed edges (`user → model → tool → output`) — explain any decision, time-travel any state.
- **Sleep-stage memory.** Memory consolidates through Light Sleep (hourly cleanup), REM Sleep (daily reflection), Deep Sleep (weekly promotion + integrity walk). *Uniclaw is the first agent runtime that sleeps.*
- **Mobile-sovereign profile.** Android-native, on-device LLM via WGSL/Vulkan, hardware-attested sensor leases.

## Quick start

```sh
# Build everything.
cargo build --workspace

# Run tests.
cargo test --workspace

# Run the standalone verifier on a receipt.
cargo run --bin uniclaw-verify -- path/to/receipt.json
```

## Engineering discipline

Uniclaw enforces several rules in CI to avoid the failure modes seen in predecessor projects (god-object kernels, config-format sprawl, plugin-as-trusted, drift on size budgets):

- **Adopt, don't copy.** Read every claw's source; never import it. Patterns are reimplemented in Uniclaw idioms with `// Pattern adapted from <project>/<file> (<license>)` citations.
- **Hard ceilings.** ≤ 5 KLOC per file in `uniclaw-kernel`, ≤ 20 crates through Phase 4, TOML-only config, size CI gate per profile.
- **Two-track development.** `trunk` (boring, shippable) + `lab` (experimental, may fail). `lab` failures must not block `trunk`.
- **Public quarterly demos.** Recorded, tagged, embarrassing if missed.
- **Adapter scarcity.** Only OpenClaw sidecar adapter ships in MVP; additional adapters require ≥ 10 GitHub thumbs of demand.
